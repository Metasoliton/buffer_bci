# Processing Signal Viewer
The Processing Signal Viewer is a reimplementation of the BCI framework 
called buffer_bci develop by the dondersBCI lab which is based on MATLAB.
This implemenation is made using processing which is a Java based tool and library.
And works for Android, Windows and linux.

The Prossessing Signal viewer is a tool that visualised realtime the data 
collectedby an EEG and can be used to check the quality of teh electrode fit 
of an EEG during an BCI experiment.

# Different documents:
There are different document accompanying the project. These are: 
- Processing Signal viewer: System documentations
- Processing Signal viewer: User documentation
- Usermanual Sigviewer (under Documentation_general) 

# Processing Signal viewer: System documentations
Here all the information can be found that you need to developing.
it contains: 
- how to get started: what and how to download, the basics of processing and
  references to tutorials.
- overview of the written program: architechture, classes and how they are 
  dependend on eachother.
- difference between the Android version and Java.
- Known Bugs that need fixing
- Future functionality that should be added.

# Processing Signal viewer: User documentation
Here you can find all the information that might be needed as a user of the system.
including:
- what to download and how
- how to install
- how to use the program/explenations.
- what can be done wrong when using it and how to solve it.

# Usermanal Sigviewer
This is a documentation that was written to help developers with the understanding 
of the buffer_bci develop by the dondersBCI lab which is based on MATLAB .

#getting started
To get started see the different manuals depending on whether you are a user or 
a developer.

# file structures:
- Documentation_general
- Original code	(a slighly addepted version of the buffer_bci develop by the
		 dondersBCI lab. This version has more comments and seperate 
		 functions.) 
- ProcessingSigViewer_V2 (The most up to date version of the project) 
- SignalProxy
- System and User Documentation (contains the user manual and system manual) 
- drawings (containing the first design drawings) 

additionally 2 executables can be found un the repository:
1) Android executable
