PROCESSING:
Installing is very easy, just unzipping a zip file and running from there.

Then you can start by writing for example:

rect(30, 20, 55, 55, 7); //for a button shape. xPos, yPos, xSize, ySize, roundness

but if you want to change the canvas size for example, first write:
void setup(){
	size(640, 360);
}

void draw(){
	rect(30, 20, 55, 55, 7); //xPos, yPos, xSize, ySize, roundness
}

//

AN EXAMPLE:
void setup() {
  size(640, 360);
}
int xPos = 30;
int yPos = 50;
int margin = 20;

void draw() {
  rect(xPos, yPos, 100, 50, 7);
  //smooth();//????
  fill(#FFFFFF); // if you dont fill the rectangle here, it is filled by whatever next fill, which is the text so then you cant read anything...

  textSize(10);
  text("Hello World!", xPos + margin, yPos + margin+10);
  fill(#000000);
  
}
One of the BEST things I found is if you press ctrl+shift+t (or Sketch -> Tweak), you can drag the numbers/colors and see your sketch change.


You can use mouseClicked and mousePressed amongst others for mouseclicks. I don't see any way to add a position to that though so we need a workaround for that.

CLASSES
Making classes happens in the same file with:
class <ClassName> {
}
