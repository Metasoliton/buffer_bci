--- Player instructions --- You will see a scene with a scientist and a robot in it. You are the scientist who will take it up against the robot in a slime bucket challenge. During multiple rounds, you will see a bucket being filled with green slime. Both you and the robot want to collect as much slime as possible and throw it over your opponent. The more slime you throw over your opponent, the more points you can earn. The robot is sneaky and will try to predict your acts by listening to your brain activity. Every time the robot thinks you are intending to act, he will flip the bucket and beat you to it. We want to know how accurate these predictions are and need your help. Every time the robot acts, you will be asked whether you wanted to act at that moment in time.‚Äù       This game exists of 2 blocks: 1. Behavioural version based on the history of your movements only.2. Brain-based version based on neural preparatory activity in your brain.--- Buffer BCI ---To get the game running, you need to download the Buffer BCI toolbox. Buffer BCI is an open-source development toolbox for building brain-computer interfaces, developed by Dr. Jason Farquhar. Buffer BCI is based on a client-server architecture with multiple clients getting and putting data to a central data and events server. The server is based on a fieldtrip buffer specification for data access and storage (see www.fieldtripfoolbox.org). The framework is available for Mac, Linux, Windows and Android. Language bindings are provided for Matlab, Octave, Java, Python, C# and C. For Matlab, Octave, Python, and Java additional signal-analysis, classification and example demonstration BCIs are provided.The Buffer BCI can be downloaded from www.github.com/jadref/buffer_bci.--- Getting started with the Buffer BCI --- 1. Once you have got the Buffer BCI toolbox installed on your laptop. There will be an option to choose a .bat/.sh file. When using a Windows computer, run the .bat files. When using Linux or MacOSX run the.sh files. 2. Indicate what EEG hardware you are using: TMSi mobita or Biosemi Active 2. Please open buffer_bci/eeg_quickstart.sh or buffer_bci/eeg_quickstart.bat in a text editor and indicate your data acquisition source with:a. dataacq = mobitab. dataacq = biosemi3. Start up a buffer, the chosen data acquisition source, an event viewer and a signal viewer: run the eeg_quickstart.sh or eeg_quickstart.bat file in a terminal or command window.4. If you do not have any EEG hardware, you can use a simulated data source: run debug_quickstart.sh or debug_quickstart.bat in a terminal or command window.--- Setting up the game ---1. Open a Matlab session2. Open flipThatBucket.m

3. Indicate what matlab version you are using and where it is located in lines 130, 153, 156 and 159. By default the folder points to: /Applications/MATLAB_R2015b.app/bin/matlab. On a PC, this folder should be: C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2015b\bin\matlab. 4. Run flipThatBucket.m. You will be asked to indicate your player number in a pop up window. Please choose any string or integer that is unique to you as a player.5. Once you hit OK, the game will start. Block 1 = 3x practice trial, Block 2 (robot predictions based on behavior) and 3 are (robot predictions based on brain activity) the real experiment. There is a short questionnaire after each block.
