READ ME: movement BCI GameSee our project wiki for more information:https://github.com/jadref/dondersBCI.github.io/wiki/Predicting-movement-intent-from-brain-activity--- The game --- In this game, you can will compete with the computer. Each trial you can earn money. The pile of money will get bigger over time. Whoever presses the button first (you or the computer) gets the current amount of money. Your goal will be to beat the computer! But beware, the computer will try to predict when you want to move and tries to “press” the button just before you!         This game exists of 3 versions: 1. Behavioural version based on the history of your movements only.2. Muscle-based version based on the muscle movements on your arm.3. Brain-based version based on neural preparatory activity in your brain.--- Buffer BCI ---To get the game running, you need to download the Buffer BCI toolbox. Buffer BCI is an open-source development toolbox for building brain-computer interfaces, developed by Dr. Jason Farquhar. Buffer BCI is based on a client-server architecture with multiple clients getting and putting data to a central data and events server. The server is based on a fieldtrip buffer specification for data access and storage (see www.fieldtripfoolbox.org). The framework is available for Mac, Linux, Windows and Android. Language bindings are provided for Matlab, Octave, Java, Python, C# and C. For Matlab, Octave, Python, and Java additional signal-analysis, classification and example demonstration BCIs are provided.The Buffer BCI can be downloaded from www.github.com/jadref/buffer_bci.--- Getting started with the Buffer BCI --- 1. Once you have got the Buffer BCI toolbox installed on your laptop. There will be an option to choose a .bat/.sh file. When using a Windows computer, run the .bat files. When using Linux or MacOSX run the.sh files. 2. Indicate what EEG hardware you are using: TMSi mobita or Biosemi Active 2. Please open buffer_bci/eeg_quickstart.sh or buffer_bci/eeg_quickstart.bat in a text editor and indicate your data acquisition source with:a. dataacq = ‘mobita’b. dataacq = ‘biosemi’3. Start up a buffer, the chosen data acquisition source, an event viewer and a signal viewer: run the eeg_quickstart.sh or eeg_quickstart.bat file in a terminal or command window.4. If you do not have any EEG hardware, you can use a simulated data source: run debug_quickstart.sh or debug_quickstart.bat in a terminal or command window.--- Setting up the game ---1. Open a Matlab session2. Open startGame.m and run it.4. When you run startGame.m, you will be asked to indicate your player number in a pop up window. Please choose any integer that is unique to you as a player.5. Once you hit OK, a menu figure will pop up. Here, you can choose what you want to do:a. Practice game: play the game independent of the buffer_bci framework. No EMG/EEG data will be collected. The computer will predict the player’s behaviour based on their action history. A logfile with the game history is saved in the logfiles folder.b. Play behavioural game (collect training data): play the game and label training data for the computer.  The computer will predict the player’s behaviour based on their action history. A logfile with the game history is saved in the logfiles folder. An additional matlab instance will run on the background to collect the labelled training data. The raw training data is saved in the data folder. When the game is finished, 3 classifiers will be trained: an EMG, RP and ERD one. The classifiers are saved in the classifiers folder.c. Play muscle game: the computer predicts the player based on their ongoing EMG activity. The trained EMG classifier from (2) is applied during the game. Classifier predictions are saved to the data folder. A logfile with the game history is saved in the logfiles folder.d. Play brain game I (RP): the computer predicts the player based on their ongoing EEG activity. The trained RP classifier from (2) is applied during the game. Classifier predictions are saved to the data folder. A logfile with the game history is saved in the logfiles folder.e. Play brain game II (ERD): the computer predicts the player based on their ongoing EEG activity. The trained ERD classifier from (2) is applied during the game. Classifier predictions are saved to the data folder. A logfile with the game history is saved in the logfiles folder.f. Play full game (muscle, ERD, RP): the computer predicts the player based on their ongoing EEG activity. The trained EMG, RP and ERD classifiers from (2) are combined and applied during the game. Classifier predictions are saved to the data folder. A logfile with the game history is saved in the logfiles folder.
